    go get github.com/thejerf/sutureslog
    
`sutureslog` is an adjunct to the
[suture](https://github.com/thejerf/suture) package. It is isolate
because sutureslog naturally needs a Go with slog in it, but I do not
want to impose that requirement on the suture library itself and break
backwards compatibility.

Documentation is available in the godoc, and as for the rest of what
suture is, see the github link to it in the previous paragraph.
